# Chrysalis
Ben, CPDigitalDarkroom, kirb, and veerklempt.

This is our project for Tweak Battles #3. Chrysalis has been submitted and will be out on BigBoss next week. This package depends on [Cephei](https://github.com/hbang/libcephei).

We've put a ton of work into this tweak and we hope you love it!

# Functionality

Chrysalis is a 3d-touch based app switcher. It's also completely gesture based. From the left of your screen, press firmly (or slide if you aren't on a 3d touch supported device) and the app switcher will show, where you can slide your finger and let go on an app, which will open it. The app switcher also has customization such as a dark mode.
