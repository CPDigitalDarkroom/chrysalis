# Chrysalis
Ben, CPDigitalDarkroom, kirb, and veerklempt.

This is our project for Tweak Battles #3. Chrysalis has been submitted and will be out on BigBoss next week. This package depends on [Cephei](https://github.com/hbang/libcephei).

Chrysalis was designed from a vision of a better 3D Touch app switcher, and to bring a convenient app switching gesture to older devices. There has never been an easier way to switch your apps efficiently before Chrysalis. Simply force press on the left edge of the screen, and Chrysalis will create an elegant new experience for you. Drag your finger to the app you would like to switch to and let go. That’s it!

Built from the ground up with lots of love, to not just be an immersive experience, but it was also built for a good cause. We made this tweak as part of the [Tweak Battles competition](http://www.tweakbattles.com/), where almost $1,000 was raised for charity.

We hope you enjoy the convenience of Chrysalis, as much as we did making it.

We've put a ton of work into this tweak and we hope you love it!

# Functionality

Chrysalis is a 3d-touch based app switcher. It's also completely gesture based. From the left of your screen, press firmly (or slide if you aren't on a 3d touch supported device) and the app switcher will show, where you can slide your finger and let go on an app, which will open it. The app switcher also has customization such as a dark mode.
